Fallback routes

-user accesses a page where page does not exist - 404
-fallback route, override 404 page

-need to be defined in web.page AT END OF FILE
-cannot go above routes

ex
-user wants to access blog post that doesn't exist
-create a controller to display all available posts instead of 404 message

FallbackController
-is same as single use controller, so use invoke method
